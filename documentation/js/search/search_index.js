db api integration can be found in movie.service.ts\nComponent communication\nPublish subscribe pattern used for inter-component communication\nDevelopment server\nRun ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nCode scaffolding\nRun ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.\nBuild\nRun ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the ../anywhr/public directory. Use the --prod flag for a production build. The ../anywhr/public is the static directory\nfor express application. It is advisable to keep both the fronend and the backend application\nside by side. \nIntegration\nBackend integration of this application is included at https://github.com/shanurrahman/anywhr-backend\nInformation\nPlease change to https://github.com/shanurrahman/anywhr-frontend/tree/bootstrapped\nRefer to https://github.com/shanurrahman/anywhr-backend\nto get in depth on how this project was created\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules -
